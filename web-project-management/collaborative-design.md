# Prototyping Exercise / Design studio

## Déroulement

### Aperçu du déroulement

1. Un objectif circonscrit \(focused goal for the exercise\) \(ex: _a checkout page for an eCommerce site\)_
2. Three rounds \(or roughly as many as you need, give or take — to reach an outcome\) of time-based sketching.
3. You’ll need paper, markers and a timer.

### Déroulement détaillé

#### ROUND \#1

1. Five minutes of solo, quiet sketching based on the defined goal.
2. Focus on quantity, not quality, i.e. sketch as many ideas as you can, do not worry about if they are good or not.
3. When the time is up, each person has a couple minutes to present their ideas and the group has a couple minutes for feedback. Time spent here is important as it adds to the overall time of the exercise. For example, for a group of five, round one can take 20 minutes easily.
4. The group is encouraged to put a green checkmark next to ideas they think work very well so they can be referenced later.

#### ROUND \#2

1. Same as round \#1 except each participant is encouraged to **steal one idea that they liked from another participant** and fold it into their sketches.
2. The focus becomes more about quality than quantity.

#### ROUND \#3

1. Same as previous rounds except the third round is hypothetically the last round and participants are encouraged to **focus on one sketch only that encompasses their best thinking** as well as the best thinking from the group that they’d like to incorporate.
