# 20 Second Gut Test

## Objectifs

Clarifier les préférences esthétiques du design

## Déroulement

1. In advance of the meeting, assemble 20 or so screen captures of web pages. Try to capture a range of approaches and styles.
2. Put them in a random \(or strategic\) sequence in a Keynote or PowerPoint presentation. Place a letter of the alphabet on each slide, so that each web page has a different letter.
3. Create a scoring sheet that has only the letters and a Likert scale for each letter. It is important that you don’t list the names of the actual web pages you are going to display; seeing what is coming in advance would be giving them more than 20 seconds to formulate an opinion.
4. At the meeting, distribute the scoring sheets, and explain the exercise. Show each slide for 20 seconds, and have everyone circle the number that represents their gut reaction for each, with 5 being highest and 1 being lowest.
5. If possible, have someone gather the score sheets and tabulate live results \(average the scores for each letter\), so that later in the meeting, you can present the top 5 and bottom 5 to discuss.
